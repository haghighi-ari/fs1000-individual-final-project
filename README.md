### Please keep in mind:
- NO PLAIGERISM
- Late submissions result in ZERO, no exceptions unless this affects you attending the rest of the program.
    - If youâ€™re a client, you wouldnâ€™t want to be kept waiting either.
    - Also, Iâ€™ll be doing my best to grade on time, so itâ€™s only fair that I get submissions on time too ðŸ™‚
